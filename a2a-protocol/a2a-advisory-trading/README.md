## Architecture Design

![A2A Advisory Trading Architecture](docs/images/adt-architecture.png)

The A2A Advisory Trading platform represents the approach to automated trading advisory through a distributed agent-based architecture. At its core, the system orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents that work in concert to analyze market conditions, assess risk on an investment decision, and execute trade.

### Agents Specialization

The Portfolio Manager Agent serves as the central orchestrator of the system, responsible for discovering user intent from their inputs, identifying relevant agents based on their stated capabilities in agent cards, and delegating tasks accordingly. It also plays a crucial role in presenting analysis findings to users and confirming their trading decisions based on reports from other agents. 

The Market Analysis Agent provides insights about market conditions, trends, and potential opportunities. It incorporates user provided financial context or investment profile to give insights of how the current sector or industry situation affects the investor in context.

The Risk Assessment Agent provides risk score assessment on the sector as a whole, or on an investing company. It incorporates user provided financial context or investment profile to determine the risk of investment for a trade decision. 

The Trade Execution then handles the final phase, managing the actual implementation of trading decisions. In this phase, user will confirm their options in executing a trade. 

This agent ecosystem ensures a structured workflow where the Portfolio Manager coordinates all interactions between users and specialized agents, maintaining a clear chain of responsibility from initial user intent to final trade execution.

### A2A Protocol

The implementation of Google's Agent2Agent Protocol as our communication framework ensures standardized and reliable interaction between agents. The protocol's structured communication patterns help maintain system integrity and ensure that all agents operate with consistent information and clear objectives.

#### Agent Discovery using Registry 
Agent discovery in our project is dynamic and environment-aware. When agents are hosted in the same AWS account, we use naming conventions and AWS APIs to automatically discover each agent’s API Gateway ID and construct their endpoints. 
This lets the Portfolio Manager query each agent’s `/.well-known/agent.json` to get capabilities and metadata at runtime. 
The discovery logic is implemented in `a2a_core/agent_registry.py`.

For cross-account, cross-org, or cross-team deployments where automatic API ID discovery is not possible, our code can fall back to a static agent registry—a list or dictionary of known agent endpoints, which can be loaded from a config file, S3 bucket, or environment variable. 
The registry logic in `agent_registry.py` checks the environment, and if dynamic discovery is not available or fails, it loads and uses the static registry instead as seen for local environment.
This design allows seamless agent discovery in both single-account (fully automated) and multi-account (manual/static) scenarios.

#### Task Delegation and Lifecycle 
When a user submits a request (via cli.py), the Portfolio Manager creates a new Task object, decomposes it into subtasks (Market Analysis, Risk Assessment, Trade Execution), and delegates each to the correct agent using HTTP requests. Task states progress from submitted → in-progress → completed or failed. The PM waits for sub-agent responses, handles missing information or errors, and, for trades, prompts the user for confirmation before final execution. All interactions, results, and status changes are tracked and auditable.

### Lightweight Serverless Architecture

Our implementation of an Agent2Agent (A2A) network using AWS serverless infrastructure, specifically Lambda and DynamoDB, serves as a streamlined demonstration of agent-based architectures in practice. While we've built our implementation on AWS, it's crucial to understand that the A2A protocol itself is platform-agnostic - agents can be hosted on any compute platform, from EC2 instances to containers or even on-premises infrastructure. We chose Lambda functions to provide a clear, simplified example of how specialized agents can communicate through HTTP endpoints via API Gateway. As organizations accelerate their adoption of agent-based systems, their internal networks may grow to encompass hundreds or thousands of agents. In this context, efficient agent discoverability and lightweight hosting infrastructure become essential for rapid deployment and scaling.

This architecture demonstrates the core principles of A2A communication while maintaining minimal infrastructure overhead and high reproducibility. Each Lambda function encapsulates a specialized agent with distinct capabilities, illustrating how agents can discover, interact, and collaborate across different hosting environments. DynamoDB complements this serverless architecture by providing consistent, millisecond-level response times and automatic scaling - capabilities crucial for high-performance agent operations. Together, this implementation serves as a practical reference model for organizations looking to build and scale agent networks while leveraging the simplicity and efficiency of serverless computing.

## Agent Interactions

![A2A Advisory Trading Discovery and Task Delegation](docs/images/adt-discovery-and-task-delegation.png)

The Portfolio Manager (PM) serves as the primary interface, intelligently routing user queries to specialized agents based on the nature of the request. Each agent is designed with specific capabilities: Market Analysis for industry and economic insights, Risk Assessment for evaluating investment risks, and Trade Execution for processing trading orders. When interacting with the system, the clarity and specificity of your queries directly influence the PM's ability to delegate tasks effectively. For market analysis, queries about industry trends, economic conditions, or sector performance will trigger the Market Analysis agent. Risk-related questions or concerns about investment safety will be directed to the Risk Assessment agent. To engage the Trade Execution agent, requests must include specific trading actions (buy/sell), quantities, and company symbols (e.g., "Buy 100 shares of XYZ"). Currently, the system processes one company or industry per request, ensuring focused and accurate responses. For complex queries that require multiple steps (such as "Find the best performing oil company to invest in"), the PM will automatically decompose the request into sequential tasks, engaging relevant agents in order - from market analysis to risk assessment, and finally to trade execution when appropriate. The effectiveness of this task delegation relies on the AI model's ability to understand and break down user requests, making clear and specific queries particularly important for optimal results.


> **Disclaimer:**
> This tool is developed primarily to demonstrate the implementation of specialized AI agents communicating via the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol in a serverless architecture. The trading scenarios and agent interactions are designed to showcase the capabilities of A2A protocol in a practical context, not to provide actual investment guidance.
